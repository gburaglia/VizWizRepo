## How To Use

## How To Install

## Methodology

We wanted to create a web application. Our chosen framework was Dash, which is built on top of Flask, Plotly. js, React and React Js.

We leveraged several python libraries, like plotly's python library for graphing and visualizations and pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

We also used javascript for flexible, animated visualization creation.???

## Motivation

We wanted to use tools that were new to us and would force us to learn and investigate.

## Future Work
Future improvements we would like to incorporate include:
 * Connecting to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to receive real-time data
 * Further connect visuals and allow cross-filtering between visualizations
 * Incorporate time-slicing into all data sources
